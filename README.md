## Installation  

To get started, download the latest version of the script using GitHub's built-in **Download ZIP** feature:

üîπ **[Download ZIP](https://github.com/hsinming/ai-tools-ahk/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**

### Setup Instructions
1. **Download the ZIP file** from the link above.
2. **Extract the contents** to a folder of your choice.
3. **Ensure that [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is installed** on your system.
4. **Run `AI-Tools.ahk`** by double-clicking the file.

When you run the script for the first time, it will create a `settings.ini` file in the same directory. This file contains the script's settings, which you can edit to customize the hotkeys, API preferences, and prompts.

Additionally, the script will prompt you to enter your **OpenRouter API key** or **OpenAI API key** if you haven't set one yet. Refer to the [OpenRouter API Guide](#openrouter-api-guide) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) for instructions on obtaining an API key.

- `Ctrl+Alt+l` - (Manual-select text - Prompt Menu) - Opens the prompt menu to pick the prompt to run on the selected text.
